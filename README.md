# City Resilience Profiling Tool - Ontology and Rel implementation

This repository holds the resources for the UN-CPRT project. The folder structure is as follows:

 * _data_: sample data shared by the UN team
 * _src/rel_: Rel source files
 * _src/julia_: julia scripts for installing relations to the KGMS and running the prototype application 
 * _notebook_: exported notebook files from RAI Console (currently empty)
 * _un-crpt_: the folder containing the Visual Studio solution file (needed for NORMA)
 * _images_: it contains screenshots used in this README

### Running on RAI Cloud

Import the three notebook files found under the _notebook_ folder to get started. These contain both the CSV data, model, and the present queries. 

To make changes, just export the updated notebook(s) and update the files on GitHub.
